\section{Fourier Transform}

The Fourier Transform is used to analyze the frequency components of a signal.

The continuous Fourier transform of a signal \( f(t) \) is given by:

\[
F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) \cdot e^{-i \omega t} \, dt
\]

This allows us to convert a time-domain signal into its frequency-domain representation.
