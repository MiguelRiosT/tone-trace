\section{Introduction to Signals}

A signal is a function that conveys information. In this project, signals are one-dimensional time series representing sound pressure.

We typically analyze signals in:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time domain} – how the signal varies over time
    \item \textbf{Frequency domain} – what frequencies make up the signal
\end{itemize}

Understanding both representations is essential to classify the origin of a sound.
