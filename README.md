![Tone Trace Demo](path-to-your-image.png)

**Tone Trace** is a lightweight signal processing tool that classifies **human voices** (male/female) and **animal sounds** (cat/dog) using **Fourier series** and **Laplace transform** techniques.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🔊 Voice and sound classification
- 📈 Signal analysis with Fourier & Laplace
- 🧠 Designed for lightweight models or experimentation
- 🐶 Supports both human and pet sound types

---

## 🧠 What Can You Do With Tone Trace?
- Build smart assistants that detect who's speaking: man, woman, cat, or dog.
- Use in **security cameras** to detect presence through specific sounds.
- Train custom classifiers for voice or animal sound recognition.
- Enhance accessibility tools through voice frequency recognition.
- Educational tool to explore signal processing with real audio data.
